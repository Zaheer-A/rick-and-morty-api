# The Rick & Morty Case

Using an API to retrive different kinds of information to showcase my skills as a developer. The following are the goals:

- Show all characters that exist (or are last seen) in a given dimension
- Show all characters that exist (or are last seen) at a given location
- Show all characters that partake in a given episode
- Showing all information of a character (Name, species, gender, last location, dimension, etc)

## Bonus

- Dockerize it
- Use awesome techniques
- Make it (the code) look pretty
- Integrate 1 or more extra API's in a creative way
- Explain in detail how a plumbus is made (yes, this is real)

## Tools

- PHP 8.1.19
- Laravel 10.21.0
- Blade
